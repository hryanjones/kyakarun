### What is this?

**Kya Karun** is a simple web-app to help you decide what to do. You enter a number of activities and the amount of time they're good for, then you tell the app how much time you have and it'll suggest an activity randomly.

### Where is my data stored?
Currently, this simple app stores everything in [browser local storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage#localStorage).

### Why?

Every time I pulled out my phone I would waste time on Twitter, which wouldn't make me happy. In the vein of [time well spent](http://www.timewellspent.io/) I made this app to help me make better decisions with my time, steering me towards activities like studying Hindi, meditating, exercising, or reading a book, and ideally to a more fulfilled life.

### Why is it called **Kya Karun**?

**Kya Karun** means "What should I do?" in Hindi.
